                In today's world, it's tempting to apply for new credit cards, especially when brands like Amazon, Shoppers Stop, and others offer attractive co-branded cards with lucrative rewards. However, the question is whether it is wise to keep signing up for new cards just for the perks, or should you stick to using your existing ones even if they offer slightly lower rewards?
              </p>

              <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100 mb-8">
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The answer is a definite <strong>No</strong>â€”you shouldn't keep accumulating credit cards just for incremental benefits. The drawbacks far outweigh the rewards. Managing multiple cards involves various challenges, including activation, timely payments, annual and joining fees, and keeping track of due dates. But the real concern is the financial impact of holding too many cards, which many people overlook.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-indigo-800">The Hidden Financial Impact of Multiple Credit Cards</h2>
              <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100 mb-8">
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  When you get a new credit card, your total available credit line increases. This might seem beneficial, but lenders assess your financial standing using a metric called <strong>FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio)</strong>.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Let's break it down with an example:</p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Scenario 1: Before a New Credit Card</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Assume your gross monthly income is <strong>INR 1 Lakh</strong>, and you have the following liabilities:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
                  <li><strong>Personal Loan:</strong> INR 2 Lakhs (EMI: INR 10,000)</li>
                  <li><strong>Auto Loan:</strong> INR 5 Lakhs (EMI: INR 15,000)</li>
                  <li><strong>Credit Cards:</strong> Total credit limit of INR 4 Lakhs, which will mean 5% of the total credit limit will be added to the FOIR</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">Your FOIR calculation:</p>
                <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
                  <p className="text-center">{'(10K + 15K + 4L * 5%)/1L = 45K/1L = 45%'}</p>
                </div>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Scenario 2: After Taking Another Attractive Rewards Credit Card</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  If you apply for a new card with a <strong>credit limit of INR 2 Lakhs</strong>, your updated FOIR will be:
                </p>
                <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
                  <p className="text-center">{'(10K + 15K + 6L * 5%)/1L = 55K/1L = 55%'}</p>
                </div>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">At this stage, everything might still seem manageable.</p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Scenario 3: When You Actually Need a Loan</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Imagine you now need a home renovation loan of <strong>INR 5 Lakhs</strong>, with an EMI of <strong>INR 20,000</strong>. Your FOIR will shoot up to:
                </p>
                <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
                  <p className="text-center">{'(10K + 15K + 20K + 6L * 5%)/1L = 75K/1L = 75%'}</p>
                </div>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  This level of indebtedness is considered high, making it difficult for banks to approve your new loan. Essentially, you might face loan rejections for crucial financial needs, all because you maximized credit card perks for luxury spending.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-indigo-800">Best Practices for Managing Credit Wisely</h2>
              <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-blue-100 mb-8">
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 text-gray-700">
                  <li><strong>Assess Your Financial Health:</strong> Before applying for a new credit card, analyze your existing credit obligations and their impact on your borrowing potential.</li>
                  <li><strong>Maintain a Healthy FOIR:</strong> Ideally, your FOIR should stay below 50% to ensure you have room for future financial needs.</li>
                  <li><strong>Prioritize Emergency Funds:</strong> Always maintain a financial cushion for unforeseen expenses rather than relying on credit.</li>
                  <li><strong>Choose Wisely:</strong> If you need a credit card, opt for one that aligns with your spending habits and offers long-term benefits rather than short-term rewards.</li>
                  <li><strong>Live Within Your Means:</strong> Avoid unnecessary debt accumulation by spending responsibly.</li>
                </ol>
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-indigo-800">Conclusion</h2>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  While credit cards offer convenience and rewards, excessive reliance on them can jeopardize your financial stability. A well-planned credit strategy ensures that you enjoy financial security and access to essential loans when you truly need them. Always evaluate your long-term financial goals before signing up for a new credit card.
