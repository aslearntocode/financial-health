        <h2>What are Mutual Funds?</h2>
        <p>
          A mutual fund is a type of investment vehicle that pools money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. This pooled approach allows individual investors to gain exposure to a broad range of investments that might be difficult to achieve on their own.
